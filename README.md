<p>
    The 1337 School MiniShell is a lightweight command-line interpreter, inspired by the Bash shell, developed by Your Name and Peer's Name. This project was created as a part of our coursework at 1337 School, where we aimed to implement a minimal version of the Bash shell with basic functionalities.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
    The MiniShell supports the following built-in commands:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>echo</code>: Displays text or variables to the terminal.</li>
    <li><code>cd</code>: Changes the current working directory.</li>
    <li><code>pwd</code>: Prints the current working directory.</li>
    <li><code>export</code>: Sets an environment variable.</li>
    <li><code>unset</code>: Unsets an environment variable.</li>
    <li><code>env</code>: Lists all environment variables.</li>
    <li><code>exit</code>: Terminates the MiniShell.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In addition to the built-in commands, the MiniShell also supports the execution of simple commands and multi-pipe commands. This allows users to run external programs and execute complex command sequences using pipes.
</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>
    To use the MiniShell, simply clone this repository and compile the source code using your preferred C compiler. Once compiled, you can run the MiniShell by executing the generated binary. The MiniShell will present a prompt where you can enter commands and interact with it.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
    Here are a few examples of how to use the MiniShell:
</p>

<pre>
$ ls -l
</pre>

<pre>
$ cd /path/to/directory
</pre>

<pre>
$ export MY_VARIABLE=my_value
</pre>

<pre>
$ cat file.txt | grep "pattern" | wc -l
</pre>
